- Removed all PV drivers
- Re-build against .NET 4  (.NET 3.5 not installed on WinServer 2012 by default)
- Added Windows Server 2012 OS detection
- Added notes to install GUI

===============================


1. The resultant executeables: EucalyptusWindowsIntegration.msi  
    and setup.exe, have to ran as "Administator" on the client.
    Failure to do so will result in a message " Cannot Open Device/File"
    during installation, and the install will fail. 

2. Automatic updating of EucaServiceLibrary.dll via floppy on existing instances.

   It is possible to invoke instances when they boot that have a older version 
   of the Eucaservice without re-creating the images to use a new version of the 
   dll service.   
   
  
   a. open EucaServiceLibrary > Properties > AssemblyInfo.cs.
   b. change AssemblyVersion and AssemblyFileVersion. For example, "1.0.0.0" -> "1.0.0.1".
   c. build the project and you will have a new DLL in the Debug folder
 
    To embed the DLL to the floppy:
  
   a. assuming you have the eucalyptus repo cloned
   b. you will see the floopy file at /tools/floppy.
   c. create a mount point (e.g., /mnt/floppy)
   d. mount the loopback file ( mount ./tools/floppy /mnt/floppy -o loop)
   e. copy the EucaService.dll to /mnt/floppy and unmount (/mnt/floppy)
   f. commit and push the updated /tools/floppy to euca repository 
      (make sure you're on the right branch).

3. Creating a iso.

   Use Deep Burner on Windows. 
  
    Add  

    EucalyptusWindowsIntegration.msi  
    setup.exe
    Eucalyptus/Licenses 

    to CD image, select "Burn" , Save as ISO.
